## Getting Started

In order to run this site, you will need a database set up to be able to use all the functions provided. I recommend download Wampserver, and setting up a database and changing the names of the tables/names as you see fit.

You will however be able to use the site and look at the different parts, as the front end is in HTML/CSS/JavaScript
